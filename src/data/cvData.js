        headlines: ["Experienced Leader", "Executive MBA", "Hands-on Builder", "Highly technical"],
        summary: `Technical Sales Specialist with over 20 years experience in Software Engineering, Management, Sales / Pre-sales Engineering, Digital Marketing and e-Commerce.

Building trust within teams, organisations, with customers and prospects is what I live by. It has been the connecting thread that has driven my career.

I am passionate about building and running teams with high level of psychological safety while keeping execution standards at the highest level. I have enjoyed becoming a trusted advisor to all my customers. I close complex deals, scale new products, act both operationally and strategically.

I enjoy consulting with large organisations to initiate, execute and manage strategic-growth generating partnerships. I am equally comfortable around a table of Engineers, Sales and Marketing Executives or C-levels to grow products, sales, teams and ultimately profits.

I have been very lucky to have a very diverse career. It is driven by a constant growth mindset and the ability to make hard technical concepts simple and to be a natural bridge builder between technical and non-technical people.`,
